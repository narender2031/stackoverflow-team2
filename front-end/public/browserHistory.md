### Browser History
 - Browser history is private for each user.
 - It cannot be accessed directly by any npm package or through inbuilt javaScript API.
 - Extension is used, permission should be allowed.

 - Links
 - [Browser History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/search)
 - [Mainfest.json Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/history)
	- Even though the extension is installed, it doesn't able to recognise what is browser.
	- ``` browser.history ```


 ### Conclusion
 - Didn't able to get what we wanted i.e. to access the complete history of browser.
